Astro is a compact professional multi-rotor aircraft designed for enterprise, industrial, and cinematic applications. Astro is built on the success of the Alta family of aircraft and includes new technologies like Auterion Skynode and Freefly SuperLight Batteries.&#x20;

Astro is the next generation of Freefly aircraft, which emphasizes expandability and customization to make sure it can stand up to all challenges thrown its way while still being the reliable workhorse drone that Freefly pilots know and love.

{% tab title="Pilot Pro" %}
The current iteration of Astro ships with [**Pilot Pro**](https://store.freeflysystems.com/products/pilot-pro)**,** our custom controller. For more information, check the [Pilot Pro wiki](https://freefly.gitbook.io/pilot-pro-public/).&#x20;

{% tab title="Herelink Controller" %}
Astro shipped with the [Herelink](../other-user-manuals/ecosystem/components/pilot-handsets/#herelink) controller as the pilot handset before late 2023. It runs a custom version of [Auterion Mission Control](essential-software/auterion-mission-control/) as its flight software.&#x20;

SuperLight Lithium-ion batteries are designed and manufactured by Freefly. You can find more information on the battery in the [SuperLight Battery](https://freefly.gitbook.io/freefly-public/products/superlight-batteries) section of the wiki.&#x20;

## Astro LEDs

There are 5 total status LEDs on the Astro. The 4 boom LEDs at the end of each arm show constant lights in most circumstances. By default, the rear two boom LEDs are red, and the front two boom LEDs are green. These LEDs will blink as the battery gets low, and blink quickly if there is an error. &#x20;

The Astro uses a multi-color status indicator LED to communicate aircraft status on the ground. This LED is located on the front-left boom of the aircraft (pictured below in blue on boom 4). See the table below for complete information on the color codes
