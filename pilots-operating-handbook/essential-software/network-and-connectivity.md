## WiFi

This section describes the connection process for Astro's built-in wifi chip. This functionality is useful while the aircraft is on the ground, for admin and setup tasks. Connecting the Astro to wifi is required to complete the initial [Auterion Suite setup process](auterion-suite.md).&#x20;
