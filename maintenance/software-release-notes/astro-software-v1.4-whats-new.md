# Astro Software v1.4 - What’s New

#### New: Pilot Pro Integration

* We just launched Pilot Pro and we think it's the best drone controller ever designed - [learn more here](https://freeflysystems.com/pilot-pro)! Astro Software v1.4 brings support for the Pilot Pro and introduces new features with it including real time velocity control dials with the new Slow Speed Mode



***

#### New: Velocity Control (aka Slow Speed Mode)

* Using the dials on the Pilot Pro allows for very accurate control of the Astro’s gimbal, ground and vertical velocities - ensuring smooth, consistent, and repeatable climbs or descents. Pilots can lower the velocity and vertical maximum speeds .1 m/s, such that a full stick command moves the machine at that maximum speed and climb rate.
* **Fine-Tuned Speed Adjustments:** Pilots can set the velocity and vertical maximum speeds as low as 0.1 m/s. At this setting, a full stick command results in the drone moving at the specified maximum speed and climb rate.
* **High-Fidelity, Controlled Movements:** By lowering the velocity clamps to a minimal setting, pilots can achieve highly precise and repeatable slow camera movements or climbs, offering exceptional control via the cyclic stick.
* **Seamless Mode Transition:** Operate in the traditional Position Mode to fly at full speed. For operations requiring more finesse, such as a tower inspection or a cinematic shot, switch to the "Position Slow" mode, where the velocity limits set by the dials are engaged for more delicate maneuvers.

#### Operational Behavior Changes:

* Mission and RTL Joystick Interaction: Moving the joysticks during Mission, Hold, or RTL modes will no longer switch to Position mode. For immediate stopping, press the Position mode button.
  * It's important to note that after executing certain automated actions, like Missions and Takeoff commands, the drone typically concludes with a Hold action. To regain manual control using the joysticks, operators must deliberately switch to Position mode.
* Photo Trigger Feedback: Enhanced feedback in AMC UI during photo capture to prevent premature triggering of the next photo. Added error sound for capture failures.
* Vehicle Timezone Configuration: Option to set the vehicle timezone on the Skynode web page. When set this will be used to name the photo folders based on the local time.
* Failsafe Options for Wind Limit: Customizable failsafe actions if wind limit threshold is reached: Warning only, Return-To-Launch (RTL, default), and Land.

#### Herelink GCS Updates:

* Gimbal Tilt Control Sensitivity: Added an option to adjust the sensitivity.
* Rocker Dead Band Adjustment: New setting to fine-tune the rocker dead band.
