# Getting Technical Support

Here is a guide to get your issues resolved faster:

* Reach out to support by emailing us at support@freeflysystems.com or via our [website](https://freeflysystems.com/contact). Texting or sending social messages will take longer.&#x20;
*   Share as much detail as possible and provide Astro's serial number.&#x20;
