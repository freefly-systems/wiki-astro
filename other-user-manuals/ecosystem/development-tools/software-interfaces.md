# Software Interfaces

Astro is PX4 and MavSDK compatible. This means a serial connection can be used to get messages from the autopilot like GPS position and velocity, or send commands to the autopilot like position and speed. Learn more here: [https://www.dronecode.org](https://www.dronecode.org/).

Astro has an onboard computer. This means your code can run in a Docker and connect via ethernet/serial to a payload, the autopilot, and the internet via LTE modem. Learn more here:&#x20;
