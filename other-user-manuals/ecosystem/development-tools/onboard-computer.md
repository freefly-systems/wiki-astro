# Onboard Computer

Astro has an onboard computer. This means your code can run in a Docker and connect via ethernet/serial to a payload, the autopilot, and via LTE modem to the internet. Learn more in the [Auterion App Dev Guide](https://docs.auterion.com/app-development/app-development).

This section will be expanded to include specifications and example code.



These features are still in development so check back!
