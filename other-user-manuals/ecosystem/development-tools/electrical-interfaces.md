# Electrical Interfaces

## **I/O and Electrical Panel**

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/IO Panel.png>)

### **USB-C**

Configured as ethernet adapter.

Functionality:&#x20;

* connection to payload
* mass storage (e.g. flash drive)
* firmware updates

{% hint style="info" %}
It is not possible to power Astro via this port. For example, to update firmware or download logs, power Astro with a battery.

### Payload

Connector type: JST-ZPD 26-pin&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-10-26 170726.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This connector can be accessed directly or to pass connections to the [Smart Dovetail](payload-mounting-interfaces.md#smart-dovetail) connector.

The mating connector to build a payload cable is [ZPDR-26V-S](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/jst-sales-america-inc/ZPDR-26V-S/2472569).

### TELEM3&#x20;

Connector: JST GH 6-pin

### **PWM**

Connector: headers, 0.1 inch spacing

PWM outputs are active when the aircraft is powered on.

#### **Setup**

In AMC, select the output pins by navigating to Menu > Vehicle Setup > Parameters. Possible outputs are:&#x20;

| IO board label | Parameter name |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| 1              | RC\_MAP\_AUX1  |
| 2              | RC\_MAP\_AUX2  |
| 3              | RC\_MAP\_AUX3  |
| 4              | RC\_MAP\_FLAPS |

For each output, select an input source channel (i.e. [Herelink hardware button](../components/pilot-handsets/#hardware-controls) you will push to trigger a change in PWM).

| Herelink  | Channel |
| --------- | ------- |
| Wheel     | 5       |
| Button D  | 10      |

PWM output values (e.g. 1100 us) are controlled by these parameters (read more in the [PX4 Parameter Reference](https://dev.px4.io/master/en/advanced/parameter_reference.html)).

| Parameter       | Function                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PWM\_AUX\_DIS1  | PWM output when autopilot is not armed. When set to -1 the value for PWM\_AUX\_DISARMED will be used. a similar parameter is availabel for each channel     |
| PWM\_AUX\_MIN1  | Minimum PWM pulse for this output. When set to -1 the value for PWM\_AUX\_MIN will be used.                                                                 |
| PWM\_AUX\_MAX1  | Maximum PWM pulse for this output. When set to -1 the value for PWM\_AUX\_MAX will be used.                                                                 |
| PWM\_AUX\_REV1  | Invert direction.                                                                                                                                           |
| PWM\_AUX\_FAIL1 | PWM output if autopilot is in failsafe mode. When set to -1 the value is set automatically depending if the actuator is a motor (900us) or a servo (1500us) |

### **CAN**

Connector: JST GH 4-pin

### **Console pinout**

Console is a special serial (UART) port that is useful for troubleshooting applications running on the IMX8 processor inside Astro.

Connector: JST GH 6-pin

### **Ethernet**

Connector: JST GH 6-pin

### **Bind Button**&#x20;

Not active or user configurable. This button is included for future expansion.

### Battery V

Connector: XT-30

* Battery Voltage: 18 - 25.2 VDC
* Continuous current: 5.5 A (overcurrent protection set to approximately 5 A)

The XT-30 connector provides direct access to the raw battery output. Please note that the overcurrent protection is set to trip around 5 A, though variations may occur, with testing showing cutoff points between 4.7 and 5.3 A. We recommend keeping the load under 4.5 A to avoid triggering the protection circuit.

**Important Notes**:

* If you are not using a gimbal, you can draw up to 4.5 A through the XT-30 connector.
* If you have a gimbal attached, which typically draws about 1 A, youâ€™ll need to limit the remaining load on the XT-30 to 3.5 - 4 A.
* The circuit responds within a few milliseconds, so any large inrush currents may activate the overcurrent protection.



{% hint style="info" %}
In order for the XT30 to behave as expected, the Herelink needs to be powered on and in communication with Astro.
