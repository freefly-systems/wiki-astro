# Herelink Controller Maintenance

{% hint style="info" %}
While Herelink is a product available for purchase outside of Freefly, please keep in mind that the Astro implementation of Herelink is uniquely tailored for optimal performance and functionality. We don't recommend accessing any of the ports available on the Herelink Air Unit, as it may interfere with some of these optimizations or may even be disabled. \
\
The [Herelink wiki](https://docs.cubepilot.org/user-guides/herelink/herelink-overview) can be helpful for some questions, but may not provide accurate information in the context of Astro. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to contact@freeflysystems.com or[ Contact Us](https://freeflysystems.com/contact) through our website.&#x20;

## Herelink Binding

{% hint style="info" %}
Only one Herelink can be paired with Astro at a time. If another remote is paired, it breaks the connection with the previous remote, even after the second remote has been powered off.

Prepare non-metallic tweezers or toothpick.
