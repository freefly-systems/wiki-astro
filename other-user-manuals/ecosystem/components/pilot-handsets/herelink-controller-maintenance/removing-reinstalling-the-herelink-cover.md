# Removing/Reinstalling the Herelink Cover

{% hint style="warning" %}
Improper installation of this seal can allow water entry to the Herelink Air Unit, which has little internal water resistance. Failure of the Herelink Air Unit would result in a loss of radio link. Repair of this unit requires the entire Astro to be sent to Freefly.
{% endhint %}

### Removing the Herelink Cover

Invert Astro. Remove 3x M2.5 x 5 BHCS and remove Herelink Cover  with Seal from the Astro Chassis underside.

### Reinstalling the Herelink Cover

1. Install Rubber Grommet

The grommet should fit snuggly into the corners of the herelink cover, and there should be a small amount of extra grommet on either end.</p></figcaption></figure>

2\. Use 3x M2.5 x 5 BHCS to mount Herelink Cover to Astro Chassis underside. Apply Loctite 222 to fasteners. Torque to 0.2 newton meters (finger tight).



![Make sure all of the cables exiting from the Herelink are being covered and none are pinched.](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (74).png>)

![Ensure the Herelink grommet's two tails are tucked back onto themselves and that the grommet fits well along its whole length.](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (29).png>)
