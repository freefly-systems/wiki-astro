# DroneDeploy

DroneDeploy Flight App does not currently support Freefly aircraft for mission planning. We recommend using Auterion Mission Control to plan and fly your mission.&#x20;

Astro imagery is ready to upload to DroneDeploy as soon as you complete your flight. Remove the USB thumb drive from Astro and upload your data from Astro Map or the Wiris Pro thermal payload to DroneDeploy for processing.
