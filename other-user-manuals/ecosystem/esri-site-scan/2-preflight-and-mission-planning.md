## Creating A Flight Plan

In this example, we will select Area Survey. The workflow for other types of missions is relatively similar.&#x20;

### Enter Mission Data

Here is where you can enter the name of your mission. If you are connected to the internet (and not the aircraft), you can also select the location of your mission, check for flight advisories, and save your map for offline use.&#x20;

### Visualization Features

By selecting the 3D option on the bottom-right corner of the map, you can switch to 3D mode. This will allow you to view the map from a variety of angles in order to better assess the coverage and safety of your mission. \
\
If you have downloaded a 3D map of the area, you can also show a graph of the aircraft's height relative to the ground. This can be invaluable in areas with a high variance in terrain height, as it will help you more accurately gauge the quality of your images as well as decrease the risk of flying into obstacles.&#x20;
