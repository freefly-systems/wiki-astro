{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIz4kCDKPQ" %}

The LR1 Payload is a next generation high resolution payload using the Sony ILX-LR1 camera, integrated into a Freefly mini gimbal.&#x20;

The 61 megapixel image resolution is ideal for mapping and inspections, and the gimbal provides expansion ports for other sensors, allowing the payload to work for a wide range of use-cases. It ships with a 24 mm lens, and [several other lenses](https://freefly.gitbook.io/astro-public/other-user-manuals/payloads/lr1-payload/payload-configuration) are supported.
