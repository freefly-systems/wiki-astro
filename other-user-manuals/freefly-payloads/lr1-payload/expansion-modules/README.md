To add additional functionality in a small package, Freefly has worked to develop a [Thermal Module](https://store.freeflysystems.com/collections/astro/products/lr1-thermal-upgrade) and a [Distance Sensor](https://store.freeflysystems.com/collections/astro/products/lr1-laser-range-finder-upgrade) module that can be attached to the LR1 payload to supercharge your workflow
