# Resetting Camera Settings

## **Resetting Camera to defaults for Astro Mapping**

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note: Normal usage should not require this process. Reset the camera settings only if the Freefly factory settings have been changed or you are having issues with your Mapping Payload and Freefly customer support has instructed this process.
{% endhint %}

The USB-C connector needs to be disconnected from the left side of the camera to reset the camera settings in Menu > Setup7 > Setting Reset > Camera Settings Reset. Use a thin driver to unplug and connect the USB-C, as it helps with the lack of clearance afforded by the gimbal.
