# Packing, Handling, and Setup

## Mapping Payload Hardware Overview

The A7R4 Payload is a fully integrated camera and gimbal system for enterprise mapping workflows.

* Learn more about the [Astro aircraft here.](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-LYU75KLzw4BcaiMGVz2/s/8dwrGJhxGd9cIvsStziq/)
* The A7R4 Payload consists of a Freefly gimbal with an integrated Sony A7R4 camera. It is developed for use with Astro and other vehicles that use the Freefly Smart Dovetail and the Pixhawk Payload Bus standard.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you purchased the A7R4 Payload by itself make sure to keep the foam it came in. This foam should be transferred to Astro's case so it can continue to protect the mapping payload when it is stored in the case.&#x20;

If you purchased an Astro Map then your case already has the gimbal foam installed!

## Gimbal Packing Foam

The foam we designed is the safest way to pack and ship your mapping payload. However, it can be cumbersome to figure out how to attach it for the first time. Here is a #protip video showing you how we do it.&#x20;

## Installing/Removing the Gimbal from Astro

{% hint style="danger" %}
Smart Dovetail is not hotswap compatible. To avoid damaging Astro or your sensor, please power off the aircraft before attaching or removing a Smart Dovetail payload.&#x20;
