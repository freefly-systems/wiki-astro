# Calibration and Tuning

## Balancing Procedure

* Loosen both fasteners in the camera hotshoe as well as the ¼-20 fastener with the washer so the camera is free to slide forward/backward.

* Hold the gimbal by its Pan/Roll arms and ensure the tilt motor can spin freely.
* Shift camera forward/backward in its slot until the camera does not tip up or down when it is positioned horizontally and released.
* To ensure the camera is very well balanced, test pointing the camera \~30 deg up/down; a well balanced camera will also not move in either of these two positions. &#x20;

* Once the camera balance is correct, tighten the ¼-20 fastener as well as the two fasteners on the hotshoe.
