Camera Settings

AMC provides control of these settings in flight by pressing the <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/SettingsIcon.png" alt="" data-size="line"> icon on the right of the screen while in Photo Mode:&#x20;

![Camera settings and their recommended defaults](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (71).png>)

AMC will override these camera body settings:

* Shooting Mode dial, if set to P.
* Exposure Compensation dial, if set to 0.&#x20;

Other camera body controls and menu options will be honored. For example:&#x20;

* Focus Mode (e.g. wide, zone).
* Exposure Metering Mode (e.g. spot).
* Exposure Compensation dial, if set to non-0 value.&#x20;

## Changing A7R-IV Settings

Astro remembers the settings that you can change within the AMC software. Next time you power on the system and when the camera establishes a connection with Astro, Astro will set these settings.&#x20;

If a setting is not exposed in the app, we are most likely not overriding this setting. In order for these settings to be changed and saved even if the unit is powered off, follow the below procedure:&#x20;

* Using the wheel on the controller, tilt the gimbal/camera down at an angle so it's easier to access the buttons on the camera.&#x20;
* Using the menu or “fn” buttons on the camera, change the desired settings.&#x20;
* Turn the camera power off by using the rotary switch on top of the camera.&#x20;
* Wait 10 seconds. The camera takes a while to save settings to its own memory.&#x20;
* Power the camera back on. Confirm that the settings that you changed have persisted.&#x20;
