## Video Workflow

A7R-IV payload is primarily intended for photos, but with some minor modifications it can be used to record video.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Astro Max (large motor variant of Astro) generally does not produce good video when flying the A7R4 Payload due to increased vibrations in flight

Data transfer to USB-C is not fast enough to record video at the Sony A7R-IVâ€™s fidelity. As such, video needs to be recorded to the Sony A7R-IV's internal memory card. You will need to purchase a faster SD card in order to record at full quality. We have tested this [Lexar Professional SD card](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NLY7N7L/ref=cm_sw_r_api_i_BTVQ1733EN5HQKWWK8GJ_0?_encoding=UTF8\&psc=1), but any full-sized UHS-II SD card should work. You will also need to change the location to which the camera saves videos and images. Press the ![](https://freefly.gitbook.io/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2177404587-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F8dwrGJhxGd9cIvsStziq%252Fuploads%252FukTmvrjPEog3ceQHegkv%252FSettingsIcon.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Df6988f99-6ad7-4947-ab60-03d5ad9e8cb8\&width=44\&dpr=4\&quality=100\&sign=3bd787d9\&sv=1) icon on the right of the screen while in Photo Mode, and change the Image Storage dropdown to Camera.

Once these settings are changed, you can switch between taking images and video footage using this button in Photo Mode:![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)
