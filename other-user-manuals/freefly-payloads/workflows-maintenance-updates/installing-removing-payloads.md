* Orient the gimbal under the aircraft so that it is facing forward and the Smart Dovetail is facing upwards.&#x20;
* Slide the gimbal Smart Dovetail into the Isolated Dovetail receiver that is on the underside of the aircraft. Slide until you hear an audible click of the safety latch and the connector is fully seated.
* Close the dovetail locking lever until tight and the gimbal is secure.

#### To remove the gimbal:

* Open the dovetail locking lever so that it is loose.
* Hold the safety latch so that it is disengaged.&#x20;
* Slide the gimbal dovetail towards the front of the aircraft to fully disengage from the Smart Dovetail Mount and remove the gimbal.
