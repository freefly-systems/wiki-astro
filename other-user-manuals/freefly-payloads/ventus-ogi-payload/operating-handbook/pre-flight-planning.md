# Pre-flight Planning

## Weather

* While Astro can fly in the rain, the Ventus OGI camera requires more stable conditions for leak detection, so we do not recommend flying in any precipitation.&#x20;
* Sensor cooling:
  * It takes approximately 10 minutes for the camera’s cryocooler to reach a stable operating temperature. During this time, the imager may display a cool-down pattern.
* The Astro's operational temperature range is -20C to +50C.

## Checks

* [x] Check that the payload is secured in the Smart Dovetail mount and that the safety latch is closed.
* [x] When you’re ready to fly, perform the standard preflight checks for Astro (found below).
