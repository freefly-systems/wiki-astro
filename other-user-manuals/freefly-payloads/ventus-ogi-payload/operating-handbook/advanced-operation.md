We recommend clearing out extra photos from your USB drive to reduce the time to sync the USB drive files with the gallery after the drive is first plugged in.&#x20;

## Live Inspection&#x20;

* Astro's flight path is displayed with a red line on the map in AMC, which can help you see the area the aircraft has already covered.
* Live video from the aircraft to the Auterion Suite is possible with a strong LTE connection. Additional information on setting up LTE on Astro is here:

{% hint style="warning" %}
DIU Blue Astros come with stealth logging enabled, which stops GPS data from being written to imagery and logs. [Stealth logging must be disabled](https://freefly.gitbook.io/astro-public/other-user-manuals/ecosystem/diu-blue-suas#logging) to allow GPS data to be written to photos.

* The Ventus OGI camera provides a 640x480 infrared image with a 1-8x digital zoom. When approaching an object of interest, we recommend keeping the aircraft a safe distance away and zooming in as much as needed to see the detail level required for inspections.
* When using Slow Speed Mode, camera tilt and pan are scaled with the zoom rate, so the control inputs become less sensitive the more zoomed the camera is.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Be careful not to become disoriented when flying with the camera zoomed in. We recommend resetting the camera zoom to 1x before flying to a new inspection location.&#x20;
