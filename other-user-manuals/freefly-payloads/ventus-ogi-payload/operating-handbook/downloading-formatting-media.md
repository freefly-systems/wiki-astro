# Downloading/Formatting Media

## Viewing Media

Images and videos can be previewed in the gallery in AMC during or after a flight.

Images from the camera are saved as JPEGs and opened in most photo software. Video is saved in MPEG-TS format with embedded KLV data.&#x20;

## USB Drive

All media is saved to the USB drive on Astro. To download photos and videos from the USB drive, remove it from Astro and insert it into a computer. Files are organized by flight in time-stamped folders.
