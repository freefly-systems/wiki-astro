#### Flight Time

A single flight with Astro carrying the OGI Payload is typically \~25 minutes. Note that the time presented in AMC is an estimate. The exact time depends on several factors, such as temperature, air density, wind speed, direction, and the aircraft's flight profile.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
To extend flight times while focusing on a fixed area of interest, consider having Astro orbit around the area. In our testing, Astro is most efficient when orbiting at 7 m/s rather than hovering. The orbit flight mode can be found by clicking on the map while on the ‘Fly’ screen, then clicking the orbit icon:&#x20;
