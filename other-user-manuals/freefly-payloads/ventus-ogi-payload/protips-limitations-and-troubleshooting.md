When powered on, the Ventus OGI may take about 10 minutes to cool down and calibrate. If you power off for only a short time, the calibration time is reduced. You do not have to wait for the cooldown to be completed before taking the flight.

## #Protips

{% hint style="success" %}
Slow speed mode makes the gimbal easier to control when zooming in.
{% endhint %}

&#x20;Learn about it under the [Precise Gimbal Control](https://freefly.gitbook.io/astro-public/astro/payloads/wiris-pro-payload/operating-handbook/precise-gimbal-control) section

{% hint style="warning" %}
Be careful not to become disoriented when flying with the camera zoomed in. We recommend resetting the camera zoom to 1x before flying to a new inspection location.

## Limitations

#### Gimbal

{% hint style="warning" %}
Do not hot-swap or plug in the gimbal when the aircraft is powered on. This can damage the aircraft or gimbal.

{% endhint %}

More details can be found in the isolator section



## Troubleshooting
