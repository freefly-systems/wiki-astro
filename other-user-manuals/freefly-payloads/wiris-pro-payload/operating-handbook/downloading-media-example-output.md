## Viewing Media

Images can be previewed in the gallery in AMC during or after a flight.

Images from the EO camera can be saved in JPEG or TIFF format, and can be opened in most photo software. EO Video is saved as an MP4 file, IR video as a .AVI file.&#x20;

Images from the IR camera can be saved as a Radiometric JPEG or TIFF. Video can be saved as Thermal Encoded or as Radiometric video. Workswell ThermoLab software is required to view thermal video shot in Radiometric mode, and can be downloaded here:

* To remove media stored on the SSD, first power the Wiris Pro Payload on the aircraft. Then connect a cable to the micro-USB port on the side of the Wiris Pro. The drive should appear on a computer as ‘Wiris SSD’, with the files organized in folders by date.
* Drag the selected media off the Wiris SSD folder on to your computer.
* Right-click and 'Eject' the Wiris drive, then power off the drone and gimbal
