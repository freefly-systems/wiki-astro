# Advanced Operation

{% hint style="info" %}
To have the images geotagged with the location of the aircraft, attach a USB thumb drive to Astro’s USB-C port and select ‘USB storage’ in the image storage options.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend clearing out extra photos from your USB drive to reduce the time it takes Astro to sync the USB drive files with the gallery when first plugged in&#x20;

## Search and rescue&#x20;

* The flight path of Astro is displayed with a red line on the map in AMC, which can be useful for looking at the area the aircraft has already covered
* Setting an isotherm to show colors between a specified temperature range can help with identifying areas of interest quicker&#x20;
* Streaming live video from the aircraft to the Auterion Suite is possible with a strong LTE connection. Additional information on setting up LTE on Astro is here:

## Inspections

{% hint style="warning" %}
DIU Blue Astros come with stealth logging enabled, which stops GPS data from being written to imagery and logs. [Stealth logging must be disabled](https://freefly.gitbook.io/astro-public/other-user-manuals/ecosystem/diu-blue-suas#logging) to allow GPS data to be written to photos
{% endhint %}

* The Wiris Pro EO camera provides 1920x1080 images and 1280x720 video from a 1-10x zoom lens. When approaching an object of interest, we recommend keeping the aircraft a safe distance away and zooming in as much as needed to see the detail level required for inspections.
* When using Slow Speed Mode, camera tilt and pan are scaled with the zoom rate, so the control inputs become less sensitive the more zoomed the camera is.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Be careful not to become disoriented when flying with the camera zoomed in. We recommend resetting the camera zoom to 1x before flying to a new inspection location.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Mapping

* The Wiris Pro Payload currently does not support mapping missions.
