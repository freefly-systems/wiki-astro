# Electrical Interface

## Connector

Wiris Pro Payload uses the Smart Dovetail interface for power, data, and control. Pinouts for this connector can be found at both links bellow:

The Wiris video and control is passed through over the ethernet pins on the smart dovetail. Info on communicating with the camera can be found in the document bellow.

The gimbal utilizes Mavlink for control from the aircraft over the UART pins.&#x20;

## Power requirements:

The Wiris is powered directly from the gimbal, these specs account for the entire package in operation. Power is drawn from the V\_BATT pins on the Smart Dovetail pinout.&#x20;
