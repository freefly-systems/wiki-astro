## Hot swapping:

{% hint style="warning" %}
No hotswap protection. Do not mate or demate Smart Dovetail while the aircraft is powered.&#x20;

If the payload has even modest capacitance or other inrush current the connector contacts on both aircraft and payload side will be eroded.
{% endhint %}

## Max Speed:

We have tested this payload up to a speed of 15m/s, climb rate of 4m/s, and descent rate of 3m/s. There has been no significant performance testing past these limits. Refer to the performance section of the Astro wiki for more information.
