# Integration for 3rd Party Applications

This payload is an integrated package that combines the EO and IR camera capabilities of the Wiris Pro with Freefly Systems gimbal stabilization, tuning, and testing. The payload uses the Smart Dovetail open-interface for PX4. The payload has been extensively tested and is natively integrated with the Freefly Astro drone, but it is certainly possible to integrate this payload on to other UAV platforms.
