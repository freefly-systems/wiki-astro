The Emesent Hovermap ST-X lidar is an excellent payload for creating detailed, accurate lidar point clouds.

### Operation modes

Hovermap can interact with Astro as a passive payload, for mapping applications that can be flown with good GPS signal in open spaces with few obstacles. &#x20;

Hovermap can also use the lidar data of the environment around Astro, and build a 3D model in real time. It can use that data for obstacle avoidance, and even allow Astro to autonomously explore GPS-denied areas like under bridges and inside tunnels and mines.&#x20;
